# Hi, I'm John!

I'm an epidemiologist and data scientist, currently working on infectious disease projects at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Prior to UCSF, I worked as a machine learning engineer at One Medical, where I primarily focused on using data and technology to improve population health. I have also worked in other health tech organizations, including Practice Fusion and Rock Health.

Outside of work, I [volunteer](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0UG6XBubGsLxgz) with a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation organization, enjoy attending arts and theater events, and like getting outdoors for hiking or kayaking.

You can learn more about my background on the [research](/research) page or from my [cv](/resume/cv.pdf). I'm also always happy to connect (or re-connect) â€” you can reach me via email ([john@schrom.org](mailto:john@schrom.org)) or text (415-758-3232).
