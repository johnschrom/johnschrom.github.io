# Hi, I'm John!

I'm an epidemiologist and data scientist, currently working on infectious diseases and global health at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). I work on [SEARCH](https://www.searchendaids.com) (HIV treatment and prevention in East Africa) and [Unidos en Salud](https://www.unitedinhealth.org) (community health site in the Mission district of San Francisco).

Prior to UCSF, I worked as a data scientist and machine learning engineer at One Medical, where I primarily focused on using data and technology to improve population health. I have also worked with other health tech companies, like Practice Fusion and Rock Health, as well as in traditional healthcare systems.

You can find more about [research I've worked on](/research), or connect with me on [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/johnschrom/) or [github](http://github.com/johnschrom), or contact me directly at [john@schrom.org](mailto:john@schrom.org).
