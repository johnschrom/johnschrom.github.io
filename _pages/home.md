# Hi, I'm John!

I'm an epidemiologist and data scientist, currently working on infectious disease projects at University of California, San Francisco.

Prior to UCSF, I worked as a machine learning engineer at One Medical, where I primarily worked on quality and population health initiatives. I have also worked in other health tech organizations, including Practice Fusion and Rock Health.

Outside of work, I volunteer with a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation organization, enjoy attending arts and theater events, and like getting outdoors for hiking or kayaking.
