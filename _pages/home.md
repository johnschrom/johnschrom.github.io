# Hi, I'm John!

I'm an epidemiologist and data scientist, currently working on infectious diseases and global health at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). I work on [SEARCH](https://www.searchendaids.com) (HIV treatment and prevention in East Africa) and [Unidos en Salud](https://www.unitedinhealth.org) (community health site in the Mission district of San Francisco).

Prior to UCSF, I worked as a machine learning engineer at One Medical, where I primarily focused on using data and technology to improve population health. I have also worked with other health tech companies, like Practice Fusion and Rock Health.

You can learn more about my background on the [research](/research) page or from my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf). I'm also always happy to connect (or re-connect) â€” you can reach me via email ([john@schrom.org](mailto:john@schrom.org)) or text (415-758-3232).
