    title: "Out of the Shadows"
    story: "It's incredible how much life comes back once you emerge from the darkness of winter! As spring has turned to summer, I've been spending more time outside: for evening walks and bike rides (while dodging the turkeys and Canada Geese), for concerts in the park (with food or drink), or taking my friends' kids to the park to play. It's been years since I've spent so much of winter in Minnesota, but it's given me new perspective on being outside and enjoying nice weather."

    title: "Sophie Calle"
    story: "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Calle'>Sophie Calle</a> is a french conceptual artist, who had a retrospective (Sophie Calle: Overshare) at the Walker. I became entranced by her work after being a participant in <a href='https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2024/10/25/ivan-talijančić-and-rachel-jendrzejewski-by-jarek-pastor/'>traces</a> (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmJM_WwZ8ls'>spy on traces</a>), an audience-of-one, immersive experience informed from Calle's work exploring death, separation, and surveillance/voyuerism/exhibitionism. I was a civilian informant tasked with identifying and following a person through downtown Minneapolis; I got caught (which destroyed any inkling I might have had about someday making that career change). This experience led me to see Exquisite Pain: her project revisiting (over and over) the narrative of the end of a relationship, juxtaposed against conversations with strangers about the worst pain of their life. That led me to see her full retrospective, including the debut of her project On The Hunt, that compares men and women's personal ads in a hunting magazine over a 120 year period."

    story: "Off to NYC for a marathon of shows for the holiday season: Stereophonic, Oh Mary, Cabaret, Maybe Happy Ending, Drag the Musical, Our Town, and Romeo + Juliet. I think I exclusively ate pizza, and still fit in a stop to Luna Luna (a forgotten artist-designed amusement park from the 1980s, which was both fascinating and, at times, reminiscent of a fever dream) and the Christmas Tree at Rockafeller Center."

I love a good adventure, whether it's attending experimental theater performances or finding an abandoned sulfur mine in the desert, they're moments and experiences that bring me joy. I don't generally use social media, but instead I prefer to share these adventures here.
